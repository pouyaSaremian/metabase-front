We’re offering Metabase as a service!

Ever since we launched Metabase, people have been asking us for a hosted version. We’ve always focused on creating an open source application that is easy to install, maintain, and upgrade for anyone who needs charting or dashboards. But we know that companies have different priorities regarding the software they run, and many want to reduce their operational footprint so that they can focus on their core business. For those companies, we now offer Metabase Cloud!

Metabase remains the easiest, open source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data. Anyone in your company can visualize and pivot data in your databases without knowing SQL, as well as make dashboards, and set up nightly stats emails and alerts. Metabase is being used by over 24,000 companies all over the world and in a wide range of industries. To date, Metabase has been downloaded 52M times, and we have thriving [user](https://discourse.metabase.com/), [developer](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) and [translator](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=200535) communities.

Metabase Cloud comes in a variety of flavors. If you’re a small company and want to keep things simple, you can start with a low\-cost version with shared resources. As you grow, you can move to a fully isolated single\-tenant installation. This provides a continuum of isolation, performance, and security. And as always, for those of our users with stringent privacy requirements \(HIPAA, PCI, etc\) or security requirements, we still recommend self\-hosting as the lowest\-fuss choice from a compliance perspective.

Additionally, our [Enterprise Edition](../product/pro.html) is available on a hosted basis. [Reach out](../help/index.html) to us if you are currently an Enterprise Edition customer who wants to migrate to Metabase Cloud or if you are interested in a trial.

To learn more or try Metabase Cloud out, just go [here](../cloud/index.html) and click `start trial`.
