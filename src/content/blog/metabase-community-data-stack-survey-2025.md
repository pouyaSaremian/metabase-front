> **Update:** The survey is now closed. We’re crunching the numbers and putting together the report. Follow us on social \([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramiro-nd/) \- [Twitter](https://x.com/metabase) to be the first to know when it’s live.

Every company’s data journey looks different. Some start with a spreadsheet and scale up fast. Others invest early in infrastructure that evolves over time. But underneath all these paths lies a bigger story: **how the modern data stack is adapting to real\-world needs, in real time**.

We want to understand how data stacks really evolve — what tools teams pick, when they bring them in, and why — and create a collective resource that benefits everyone in the data community by showing what actually works in the real world, without the fancy marketing talk.

Enter the Metabase Community Data Stack Survey 2025: our invitation to share your lived experience, gain insights from peers, and contribute to a no\-BS guide to what’s actually shaping modern data practices.

## Why take part?

- **It’s quick and straightforward** : We’ve kept it simple so you can share what matters without taking up too much time.
- **Your insights matter** : Help us tell the *real* story behind decisions companies are making at different stages, the challenges around building a data stack, and how you’re overcoming them.
- **Benchmark your stack** : See how your tools compare to what teams at other companies are using—from early\-stage startups to large enterprises.
- **Help uncover trends** : Your answers highlight what’s on the rise, decline, what actually works in production environments versus what’s just hype.
- **Make your voice count** : Put your favorite tools on the map. Your input can shape where the industry is heading.

The survey should take somewhere between 7 and 15 minutes of your time. We know that’s not nothing, but we’ve done our best to keep it short while still covering what matters. If you’re able to set aside a few minutes, we’d really appreciate it—it won’t take long, and your input will mean a lot to us. The survey will be open for 4 weeks.

Once responses are in, we’ll analyze them and prep a report that breaks down how companies of all stages and industries are approaching their data stack choices. The report will be open to everyone in the community — a chance to see how your setup compares and get a clearer view of what’s working out there.

And as a thank you for completing the survey, you will get early exclusive access to the report.

## Share your experience and help build a collective resource for data teams everywhere

Join us in creating the honest, practical guide to data stacks that we all wish we had. Your experience today becomes the roadmap others will follow tomorrow\-and your early access to the results might just help shape your next strategic move.
