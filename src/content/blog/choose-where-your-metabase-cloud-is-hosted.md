Speed up your Metabase by hosting it closer to you and your data with new cloud\-hosting options in the EU \(Frankfurt\), APAC \(Singapore\), or LATAM \(São Paulo\).

Until now, all of the Metabases hosted in our cloud were in the US. Now you get a choice. If you’re in Europe, for example, you can save sending your queries going on a roundtrip to America.

## How to choose your hosting region

Whether you’re [setting up a new Metabase](https://store.metabase.com/), or moving your existing Metabase, we’ve tried to make it quick and painless:

- When setting up a new Metabase, you can specify your preferred hosting region.
- To change regions for an existing Metabase, [login to your store account](https://store.metabase.com/) , head to **Instances** , then **Change region** .

Please note that you may need to add [our IP addresses](../docs/latest/cloud/ip-addresses-to-whitelist.html) to the whitelist if your data sources are behind a firewall so they don’t block calls from your Metabase Cloud to your connected databases.

## Why hand your hosting over to us

You get automatic, worry\-free upgrades, backups, unlimited technical support, and more. You’ll have a production\-grade deployment by a team of experts, with none of the time, effort, and creeping costs of self\-hosting. Our architecture prioritizes isolation, so each hosted customer gets their own container, no clusters — that’s a commitment we’ve ensured we can deliver as we offer hosting in multiple regions.

We could go on, but we’ve covered the benefits of Cloud at length [on our Cloud product page](../cloud/index.html), and in our post on [Why Metabase Cloud](why-metabase-cloud.html).

You can migrate to Metabase Cloud any time and all of your artifacts will make the journey with you \(questions, collections, groups, etc\). [Or try Metabase Cloud for free for 14 days](https://store.metabase.com/checkout).

Thanks for being part of our quest for global domination using Metabase!
