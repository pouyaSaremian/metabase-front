The FIRE \(Financial Independence Retire Early\) movement has been a growing trend in recent years. While there are plenty of FIRE calculators to help you figure out how long it would take you to retire early, we were curious to see how geography affected those calculations. Read about our exploration below \(or skip right to the [FIRE calculator](https://metabase-public.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/ec25ca01-00bf-4057-86a5-5faae03beb9d)\).

We were able to gather open datasets on the internet and pulled them into Metabase to help us find the answers.

[Years to Retire by Country](https://metabase-public.metabaseapp.com/public/question/753a2403-7e12-4e0c-904b-fcecd9dd4278) — The y\-axis shows the number of years the average citizens of these countries can reach FIRE. The bubble size represents the projected networth in $.

## Observations

- According to the latest [personal savings rate statistics](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/personal-savings) , people in Eastern Asian countries like Japan and South Korea are able to reach FIRE the fastest \(in 14 years for Japan, and in 25 years for South Korea\). Both nations boast the highest savings rate.
- Despite having one of the highest average incomes in the world, North Americans will take the longest to reach FIRE \(55 years for Canada and 65 years for the US\).
- While some nations have better pension plans for their citizens \(especially in Northern Europe and Australia\), we weren’t able to find any correlation between years to retire vs. the quality of the pension plans \(higher pension index values are better\). We’d assumed that people in countries with better pensions plans would have lower savings rates \(the thinking here being that, because they could rely on their pensions, they could afford a higher spending rate\), but the data didn’t support this assumption.

[Years to Retire vs Pension Index Value](https://metabase-public.metabaseapp.com/public/question/847b7eb0-d55b-497b-a3af-7323b7d0e66a). There was no correlation between **Years to Retire** and **Pension Index Value**.

## Calculate how long it’ll take you to retire early

![When can I retire?](../images/posts/fire-calculator/fire-calculator.gif)

The calculations above are based on national average. To achieve FIRE faster, you should shoot for better than the average. This [calculator](https://metabase-public.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/ec25ca01-00bf-4057-86a5-5faae03beb9d?%2524_annual_income=45000&%2524_annual_expenses=42700&%2524_current_portfolio_value=0&annual_roi=0.05) can help you estimate how long it would take you to FIRE.
