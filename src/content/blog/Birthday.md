Last year on October 21st, we [released Metabase into the wild](unveiling-metabase.html). Since then, we’ve shipped 9 major versions, had 38 contributors, 3.5k stars on github, and over 100k downloads. Companies large and small are using us in 110 countries across the world. The team is jazzed and we’ll be delivering a lot more this coming year!

If you’re in San Francisco, come join us for a small celebration. We’ll be at [Southern Pacific](https://www.yelp.com/biz/southern-pacific-brewing-san-francisco) at 7\-10pm on 10/27. Please [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/metabase-birthday-party-tickets-28746912790) to let us know how many people to expect.

If you’re not in the area, know that we appreciate your feedback, kind words and all your help in making Metabase what it is today.

Love,
The Metabase Team
