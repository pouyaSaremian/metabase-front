          <h2>What's the difference between Metabase and Looker?</h2>
          <p>
            TL;DR Lots of people who have worked with Looker in the past now
            choose Metabase because you get similar outcomes at a <a
              href="/pricing/">fraction of the price</a
            >, without needing to know a proprietary modeling language. Metabase
            also has a lower learning curve and lets non-technical and
            less-data-savvy teammates query data with or without SQL.

                Credit where it’s due - Looker can be a good fit for very
                technical teams who need more extensive governance and modeling
                strictly in code, with a lower need for everyone in the org to
                be able to jump in and run their own reports. It’s got all the
                bells and whistles - and depending on the maturity of your org,
                your use case and needs, it may be more than you need.

                their teams get answers from data on their own so they’re not
                running the same reports once a month. Metabase Pro and
                Enterprise is generally chosen by CTOs, CPOs, Heads of Data who
                have been there, done that with every other BI tool on the

                There’s no right or wrong answers here. It will generally depend
                on your use case, how much you want people to be able to learn
                from data and run reports on their own without depending on your
                data team; your preferred data stack, how fast you need to get
                up and running, your budget, and more.

                Again, there’s no “right” answer, but just sayin’ - Metabase
                will let everyone on your team work with data, integrates with
                your preferred data tools, gets up and running in 5 minutes
                flat, and suits all budgets (and you can try it for free).
