          <h2>What's the difference between Metabase and Superset?</h2>
          <p>
            TL;DR Superset has a lot of advanced data analysis functionality and
            a really broad range of complex visualization options. However, it
            requires a good amount of technical expertise and resources to
            deploy and manage. Metabase can be <a
              href="https://store.metabase.com/checkout"
              >installed and maintained without any technical skills</a
            >, and lets everyone query and learn from data.

                Credit where it’s due - Superset can be a good fit for very
                technical teams with more extensive data analysis needs, and a
                lower need for everyone in the org to be able to jump in and run
                their own reports. It’s got all the bells and whistles - and
                depending on the maturity of your org, your use case and needs,
                it may be more than you need.

                There’s no right or wrong answer here. It will generally depend
                on your use case, how much you want people to be able to learn
                from data and run reports on their own without depending on your
                data team; your preferred data stack, how fast you need to get
                up and running, your budget, and more.
              </p><p>

              </p><p>
                Again, there’s no “right” answer, but just sayin’ - Metabase
                will let everyone on your team work with data, integrates with
                your preferred data tools, gets up and running in 5 minutes
                flat, and suits all budgets (and you can try it for free).
