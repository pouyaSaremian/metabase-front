                Credit where it’s due - Tableau can be a good fit for larger
                enterprises or orgs with more extensive data analysis needs,
                deep pockets, and a lower need for everyone in the org to be
                able to jump in and run their own reports. It’s got all the
                bells and whistles - and depending on the maturity of your org,
                your use case and needs, it may be more than you need.

                Metabase and Tableau give people a way to visualize their data
                and make sense of the numbers. But Metabase is so much more than
                just a visualization tool. For people who feel like they’re
                seeing double when staring at columns, it’s an intuitive way to
                filter and summarize to uncover trends and get insights to make
                data-driven decisions.

              Ok, give it to me straight though - what’s the best Business

                There’s no right or wrong answers here. It will generally depend
                on your use case, how much you want people to be able to learn
                from data and run reports on their own without depending on your
                data team; your preferred data stack, how fast you need to get
                up and running, your budget, and more.

                Again, there’s no “right” answer, but just sayin’ - Metabase
                will let everyone on your team work with data, integrates with
                your preferred data tools, gets up and running in 5 minutes
                flat, and suits all budgets (and you can try it for free).
