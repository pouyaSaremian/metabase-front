          <h2>What's the difference between Metabase and Looker Studio?</h2>
          <p>
            TL;DR If you’re using Looker Studio with Google Sheets or Google
            Analytics and feeling a little boxed in, Metabase could be your next
            step up. Both tools help you visualize data, but Metabase gives you
            more room to grow—especially when your questions (or your data) get
            more complex, or you just need more from your visualizations and
            dashboards. <br /><a

              integration</a
            >, and turn them into fully interactive dashboards with filters,
            drilldowns, and subscriptions.

                Credit where it’s due — Looker Studio can be a solid choice if
                you're deep in the Google ecosystem and just need lightweight
                dashboards connected to Google Analytics or Ads. If your needs
                are pretty basic and you're mostly using Sheets or GA, it might
                do the job just fine.

                Teams that want better interactivity, clearer visuals, and more
                room to grow. A lot of teams start with Looker Studio because
                it’s free and easy with Google products — but as they want
                drill-throughs, better filtering, or less clunky dashboards,
                they move to Metabase. Usually it’s operations, product,
                marketing, or HR teams looking to explore their data more
                freely.

                Pretty much — and often with more flexibility and polish.
                Metabase connects to Google Sheets (via Cloud), lets you share
                dashboards externally, visualize KPIs, and even schedule
                dashboards to send automatically. Plus, when your data outgrows
                Sheets, Metabase is ready to scale with you.

                Metabase offers an open source version that’s totally free to
                use, plus affordable cloud plans with built-in storage, sharing,
                and support. Looker Studio is free too — though more advanced
                versions (Looker Studio Pro or the full Looker product) may
                require a Google Cloud contract and come with additional cost
                per user or seat.

                Nope! Both let technical folks use SQL, but Metabase makes it
                easier for everyone else. Its visual Query Builder lets you
                filter, group, and explore without writing a single line of
                code. If you love SQL, go wild — but if you don’t, that’s cool
                too.

                Both tools let you build dashboards and charts — but Metabase
                gives you more to work with. You get richer filtering,
                drill-throughs, interactive dashboards, and prettier defaults.
                If Looker Studio feels a bit rigid or clunky, Metabase might
                feel like a breath of fresh air.

                Yes! Metabase’s Cloud plans include built-in support for Google
                Sheets via Metabase Cloud Storage. Just link your sheet or Drive
                folder and Metabase keeps your data in sync — no ETL needed. You
                can slice, filter, and visualize Sheets just like any other
                table.

                Honestly? It depends on what you need. But if you’re looking for
                something that’s powerful, super user-friendly, and grows with
                your team — Metabase checks a lot of boxes. We’re biased, sure,
                but you can try it free and see for yourself.

                And if you’re comparing options, our <a

                > post lays out how we stack up against other BI tools.

                Again, there’s no “right” answer, but just sayin’ — Metabase
                will let everyone on your team work with data, integrates with
                your preferred data tools, gets up and running in 5 minutes
                flat, and suits all budgets (and you can try it for free).
