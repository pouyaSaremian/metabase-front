          <h2>What's the difference between Metabase and Power BI</h2>
          <p>
            Power BI has a steeper learning curve than Metabase. People (even
            non-technical or data-savvy folks) actually like using Metabase,
            because it’s easier to learn, meaning they’re more likely to run
            reports and get data on their own.

                Credit where it’s due - Power BI can be a good fit for larger
                enterprises or orgs with more extensive data analysis needs,
                deep pockets, and a lower need for everyone in the org to be
                able to jump in and run their own reports. It’s got all the
                bells and whistles - and depending on the maturity of your org,
                your use case and needs, it may be more than you need.

                There’s no right or wrong answer here. It will generally depend
                on your use case, how much you want people to be able to learn
                from data and run reports on their own without depending on your
                data team; your preferred data stack, how fast you need to get
                up and running, your budget, and more.
              </p><p>
                If you’re curious about how other BI tools compare, check out
                our <a href="/blog/metabase-alternatives"

              </p><p>
                Again, there’s no “right” answer, but just sayin’ - Metabase
                will let everyone on your team work with data, integrates with
                your preferred data tools, gets up and running in 5 minutes
                flat, and suits all budgets (and you can try it for free).
