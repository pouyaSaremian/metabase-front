        <p>Effective date: 10/01/2015</p>

        <p>
          Welcome to Metabase. Please read on to learn the rules and
          restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products,
          Software (as defined herein), services and applications (the
          “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns
          regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us by email at

        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you
          and Metabase, Inc. (“Company,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and
          accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the
          Services on this website. Your using the Services in any way means
          that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in
          effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions
          in this document, as well as those in the <a href="/privacy"
            >Privacy Policy</a
          > and <a href="/copyright">Copyright Dispute Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that the terms of service here are for Metabase.com and
          its subdomains. Metabase the application is licensed under the AGPL
          (see <a href="/license/">details here</a>), or a commercial license as
          appropriate for the edition of Metabase you are using. The terms below
          do not apply to the usage of the Metabase application.

        <p><strong>Will these Terms ever change?</strong></p>

        <p>
          We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
          need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change
          the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
          attention by placing a notice on the metabase.com website, by sending
          you an email, and/or by some other means.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
          unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
          Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
          Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
          modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
          signed by both you and us.

        <p>
          You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password
          and user name (“Company User ID”). You promise to provide us with

          to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to
          anyone else without our prior written permission.

          this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
        </p>

          laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and

        <p>
          If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between
          users and any third party, you agree that Company is under no
          obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute
          with one or more other users, you release Company, its officers,
          employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of
          every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
          disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such
          disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you
          shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which
          says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
          does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
          executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially
          affected his settlement with the debtor.”

        <p><strong>Will Company ever change the Services?</strong></p>

        <p>
          We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over
          time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we
          may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or
          restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you
          notice when we make a material change to the Services that would
          adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we
          reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time,
          for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you
          contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole
          discretion, and without notice.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Does Metabase cost anything?</strong></p>

        <p>
          The Company Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to
          charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you
          before any Services you are currently using begin carrying a fee, and
          if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all
          applicable fees for such Services.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What if I want to stop using Metabase?</strong></p>

        <p>
          You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at
          legal@metabase.com; please refer to our <a href="/privacy"
            >Privacy Policy</a
          >, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat
          information you provide to us after you have stopped using our
          Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Company is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of
          the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion,
          including your breach of these Terms. Company has the sole right to
          decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set
          forth in these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Account termination may result in destruction of any Content
          associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide
          to terminate your account. If you have deleted your account by
          mistake, contact us immediately at legal@metabase.com – we will try to
          help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or
          restore anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
          Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the
          following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us
          or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding
          ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding
          disputes between us.
