                    PostgreSQL plays well with most reputable BI tools. Metabase
                    is the most effective way to let everyone in the team start
                    working with data. * Because of sophisticated but
                    easy-to-use data tools like the query builder, which lets
                    people ask questions without SQL, Metabase has a low
                    learning curve. Simple drill-through, zoom-in, and breakout
                    functionality lets people learn more from data with just a
                    few clicks.
                  </p><p>
                    You can set up and connect Metabase to PostgreSQL in about 5
                    minutes and begin querying immediately, with drill-through
                    functionality automatically generated and ready for people
                    to start uncovering insights. Metabase is also open source
                    and affordable, with plans and pricing that scales with you.

                    Metabase fits with PostgreSQL as a querying and
                    visualization layer on top of your data. With Metabase you
                    can query data in PostgreSQL - with or without SQL - to
                    create a broad range of data visualizations and types and
                    tell a story with interactive dashboards. Viewers can filter
                    and drill-through to get what’s most relevant, and dig
                    deeper on what’s important to them. Visualizations and
                    dashboards can even be shared or embedded in your app.

                    Metabase makes it possible for everyone in the team to run
                    their own reports, without data skills or relying on someone
                    else to write SQL for them. People used to working in Excel
                    can leverage skills usually reserved for spreadsheets to get
                    the answers they need from data in PostgreSQL.

                    Metabase lets you bring together charts, visualizations, and
                    questions into interactive dashboards that can be shared
                    with your team and customers.
                  </p><p>
                    The automatically generated drill-through menu lets people
                    click on charts to zero in on a particular category or
                    parameter for further analysis; view individual records, or
                    zoom in on a targeted date range. You can also add filters
                    to let people slice the data on what’s most important to
                    them, and add custom-click behaviors to guide data discovery
                    (e.g. send people to a related dashboard).
