              From column-oriented, distributed data in Apache Druid, to
              insights in Metabase
            </h1>

            <p>
              If you’re using Druid, you’re probably looking for a business
              intelligence tool that can keep up with massive quantities of
              time-series and event data. Metabase lets your whole team
              visualize and explore your data in Apache Druid with or without
              SQL. Run native queries on nested data and scale indefinitely.
            </p>

            <ul class="checklist-outline">
              <li>
                Analyze vast amounts of data with a querying layer that sits on
                top of your data warehouse so your reports run as quick as
                Druid.
              </li>

              <li>
                Metabase lets everyone in your team visualize, query, and run
                reports without technical skills or needing to ask your data
                team for help.

                    Metabase is one of the only business intelligence tools that
                    allows you to work with Druid without a custom connector.
                    Most business intelligence tools are designed to work with
                    tabular, row-and-column data.
                  </p><p>
                    Metabase is the most effective way to let everyone in the
                    team start working with data. * Because of sophisticated but
                    easy-to-use data tools like the query builder, which lets
                    people ask questions without SQL, Metabase has a low
                    learning curve. Simple drill-through, zoom-in, and breakout
                    functionality lets people learn more from data with just a
                    few clicks.
                  </p><p>
                    You can set up and connect Metabase to Druid in about 5
                    minutes and begin querying immediately, with drill-through
                    functionality automatically generated and ready for people
                    to start uncovering insights. Metabase is also open source
                    and affordable, with plans and pricing that scales with you.

                    You can connect to Druid when you’re setting up a new
                    Metabase instance, or add a database connection any time in
                    your admin settings.
                  </p><p>
                    You can connect your Metabase to Druid by using Metabase
                    fields to input your connection details.
                  </p><p>
                    To add a database connection, click on
                    the&nbsp;gear&nbsp;icon in the top right, and navigate
                    to&nbsp;Admin

                    Druid permissions can't be impersonated in Metabase. (This
                    is currently possible for PostgreSQL, Redshift, ClickHouse,
                    and Snowflake databases).
                  </p><p>
                    With granular row-level permissions and user group mapping,
                    you can effectively set up permissions to match those
                    applied in Druid.

                    Metabase fits with Druid as a querying and visualization
                    layer on top of your data. With Metabase you can query data
                    in Druid - with or without SQL - to create a broad range of
                    data visualizations and types and tell a story with
                    interactive dashboards. Viewers can filter and drill-through
                    to get what’s most relevant, and dig deeper on what’s
                    important to them. Visualizations and dashboards can even be
                    shared or embedded in your app.

                    Druid lets you store and analyze non-tabular, distributed
                    data sets - but you’ll likely need pretty advanced data and
                    technical skills to be able to do it.
                  </p><p>
                    Metabase makes it possible for everyone in the team to run
                    their own reports, without data skills or relying on someone
                    else to write SQL for them. People used to working in Excel
                    can leverage skills usually reserved for spreadsheets to get
                    the answers they need from data in Druid.

                    Metabase lets you bring together charts, visualizations, and
                    questions into interactive dashboards that can be shared
                    with your team and customers.
                  </p><p>
                    The automatically generated drill-through menu lets people
                    click on charts to zero in on a particular category or
                    parameter for further analysis; view individual records, or
                    zoom in on a targeted date range. You can also add filters
                    to let people slice the data on what’s most important to
                    them, and add custom-click behaviors to guide data discovery
                    (e.g. send people to a related dashboard).
