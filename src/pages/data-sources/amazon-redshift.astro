            <p>
              If you’re looking for a way to analyze and make sense of petabytes
              of data stored in Redshift, you need BI that can make light work
              of your large datasets. Metabase lets your whole team visualize
              and explore your data in Redshift, with or without SQL. Run native
              queries and analyze structured and unstructured data in your data
              lake via Redshift.

                    Redshift pairs with a number of BI tools - including
                    Amazon’s own Quicksight. While this gives you a good way to
                    keep everything in the Amazon ecosystem, Metabase is the
                    most effective way to let everyone in the team start working
                    with data. Because of sophisticated but easy-to-use data
                    tools like the query builder, which lets people ask
                    questions without SQL, Metabase has a low learning curve.
                    Simple drill-through, zoom-in, and breakout functionality
                    lets people learn more from data with just a few clicks.
                  </p><p>
                    You can set up and connect Metabase to Redshift in about 5
                    minutes and begin querying immediately, with drill-through
                    functionality automatically generated and ready for people
                    to start uncovering insights. Metabase is also open source
                    and affordable, with plans and pricing that scales with you.

                    Yes! Permissions set up in your Redshift database can be
                    impersonated in Metabase. (This is currently only possible
                    for Redshift, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and ClickHouse
                    databases)
                  </p><p>
                    With granular row-level permissions and user group mapping,
                    you can effectively set up permissions to match those
                    applied in Redshift.

                    Metabase fits with Redshift as a querying and visualization
                    layer on top of your data. With Metabase you can query data
                    in Redshift - with or without SQL - to create a broad range
                    of data visualizations and types and tell a story with
                    interactive dashboards. Viewers can filter and drill-through
                    to get what’s most relevant, and dig deeper on what’s
                    important to them. Visualizations and dashboards can even be
                    shared or embedded in your app.

                    Redshift helps you analyze unstructured, semi-structured,
                    and structured data stored in Amazon S3 - but you’ll likely
                    need pretty advanced data and technical skills to be able to
                    do it.
                  </p><p>
                    Metabase makes it possible for everyone in the team to run
                    their own reports, without data skills or relying on someone
                    else to write SQL for them. People used to working in Excel
                    can leverage skills usually reserved for spreadsheets to get
                    the answers they need from data in Redshift.

                    Metabase lets you bring together charts, visualizations, and
                    questions into interactive dashboards that can be shared
                    with your team and customers.
                  </p><p>
                    The automatically generated drill-through menu lets people
                    click on charts to zero in on a particular category or
                    parameter for further analysis; view individual records, or
                    zoom in on a targeted date range. You can also add filters
                    to let people slice the data on what’s most important to
                    them, and add custom-click behaviors to guide data discovery
                    (e.g. send people to a related dashboard).
