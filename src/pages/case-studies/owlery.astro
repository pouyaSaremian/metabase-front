                <strong>The Challenge: </strong> Owlery had been relying on a custom-built
                system for their in-app dashboards and reports. However, as they
                grew, they faced significant challenges in terms of efficiency and
                scalability. The process of creating and maintaining dashboards was
                resource-intensive, often requiring engineers to spend days fine-tuning
                each report. Given the size of their team, this approach was not
                sustainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The Solution: </strong> Owlery chose the <a
                  href="/product/embedded-analytics-sdk"
                  >embedded analytics SDK for React</a
                > for a few key reasons–The SDK offers maximum control over UX and
                component interactions with a great developer experience; the user-friendly
                UI lets non-technical customers run their own reports with confidence;
                and hands-on technical help with implementation from the Customer
                Success engineers.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The Results: </strong> For Owlery, the embedded analytics
                solution aligns directly with their long-term product vision to support
                supply chain teams. As they continue to evolve, they plan to leverage
                Metabase’s SDK to build even more advanced features and integrations.

              <h4 id="why-metabase">Why Metabase</h4>

              <p>
                After evaluating several embedded analytics solutions including <a
                  href="/lp/metabase-vs-tableau">Tableau</a
                >, <a href="/lp/metabase-vs-looker">Looker</a>, Sigma,
                Thoughtspot, and others, Owlery decided the Embedded Analytics
                SDK was the best fit for their needs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Travis explained, “We knew we wanted control over the entire
                user experience. The iframe embedding just didn’t offer enough
                customization for what we envisioned. The SDK gave us the
                flexibility to integrate analytics seamlessly into our product
                and give our customers a more personalized experience.”
              </p>

              <p>
                The SDK allowed Owlery to embed Metabase’s analytics directly in
                their app, ensuring that dashboards and charts felt like a
                natural extension of their product. They could control the
                layout, presentation, and functionality to match their specific
                use cases, which is critical for aligning with their long-term
                product goals.
              </p>

              <h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

              <p>
                To meet growing customer expectations for faster, more flexible
                insights, Owlery knew they needed a solution that would allow
                both their team and their customers to create and manage
                dashboards without constant engineering involvement.
              </p>

              <p>
                “We wanted to be able to shape the experience for our customers
                in a way that felt natural to them. With the SDK, we had the
                flexibility to integrate analytics exactly how we wanted,”
                Travis explained. “It wasn’t just about embedding charts; it was
                about embedding an experience that fit seamlessly within our
                product.”
              </p>

              <p>
                As Owlery grew, they faced several challenges with their
                custom-built analytics solution:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Engineering bottlenecks in dashboard development and
                  iterations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Time-consuming back-and-forth between analysts and developers
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited ability to quickly respond to customer requests for
                  dashboard modifications
                </li>
                <li>
                  Resource-intensive process for implementing features like
                  filtering and PDF exports
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                “When you make a dashboard, it’s never what you think it is the
                first time,” explains Travis Downs, Co-founder at Owlery. “You
                look at the data and realize you need to slice it differently,
                view it by month, or shift the KPIs. Those time-consuming
                iterations with our engineering team made me pause and think
                there had to be a better way.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Owlery’s implementation focused on security and ease of use:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <a href="/product/embedded-analytics-sdk"
                    >embedded analytics SDK</a
                  > was configured to maintain a consistent look and feel with their
                  application
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="/features/data-sandbox">Row-level security</a> ensures
                  customers only see their own data
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="/docs/latest/embedding/sdk/authentication"
                    >Authentication</a
                  > integration was prioritized during the initial setup
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 id="the-results">The results</h4>

              <p>
                The switch to Metabase’s embedded analytics SDK delivered
                significant improvements:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Big Time Savings</strong> - Modifications to dashboards
                  have been reduced from 2+ days of engineering time to about 2 hours
                  of customer success time. This vastly improves their response time
                  to customer requests, eliminates back-and-forth between teams,
                  and lets their engineering team focus on their core product. “It’s
                  gone from an engineer spending a couple days on a dashboard, to
                  our Customer Success team spending a couple of hours on it,” notes
                  Downs. “That efficiency gain has been transformative for our small
                  team.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Everyone can use data</strong> - The self-service functionality
                  not only saves engineering time but also allows Owlery’s customers
                  to take more ownership of how they access their data. “Now, customers
                  can make their own decisions based on real-time data without waiting
                  for us to make changes,” Travis explained. “This is a huge benefit
                  for both our team and our customers.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Enhanced flexibility and scalability</strong> - By switching
                  from hand-rolled reporting to Metabase’s embedded analytics SDK
                  for React, Owlery can now scale their solution with a fraction
                  of the effort, allowing them to manage permissions, security, and
                  performance without worrying about individual dashboard builds.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                “The ability to embed Metabase with the SDK allowed us to scale
                our analytics much more easily. Instead of building dashboards
                for each individual customer, we can now provide a flexible,
                customizable experience that meets the needs of every user, all
                while maintaining robust security and permissions management.”
              </p>

              <p>
                “Our product vision has always been to empower users with their
                supply chain data,” Travis emphasized. “The Metabase SDK gives
                us the foundation to continue building on that vision. We can
                evolve our product, add more features, and continue providing a
                rich, customizable analytics experience as we grow.”
              </p>

              <h4

                Why Metabase’s Embedded Analytics SDK for React was the right
                choice
              </h4>

              <p>
                For Owlery, the decision to choose Metabase’s SDK over iframe
                embedding was about having control over their user experience,
                customizing the solution to fit their brand, and ensuring
                scalability as they grew. The SDK has enabled them to deliver
                rich, personalized analytics to their customers while saving
                time and resources on development and maintenance.
