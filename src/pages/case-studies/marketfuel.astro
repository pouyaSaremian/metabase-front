                <strong>The Challenge: </strong> With years of experience in the
                promotional marketing industry, Marketfuel’s founder and CTO, Brian
                Urso recognized the lack of technical solutions for agencies to maintain
                on-brand storefronts, manage inventory, and fulfill orders with integrated
                analytics features. Existing solutions offered basic dashboards with
                limited customization, leaving agencies underserved. Their vision
                for Marketfuel was to provide a highly customizable eCommerce interface—think
                Shopify but with significantly broader branding options.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The Solution: </strong> The Embedded Analytics SDK provided
                Marketfuel with the flexibility to selectively embed Metabase UI
                components, apply dynamic theming, and seamlessly integrate these
                components into their interface. Adopting a low-risk, experimental
                approach, the team integrated Metabase quickly and efficiently.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>The Results: </strong> Using the Embedded Analytics SDK,
                Marketfuel launched their product faster than they could have by
                building the analytics infrastructure themselves. By focusing on
                customer engagement instead of technical hurdles, the team reached
                critical milestones ahead of schedule.

                "Using Metabase saves us time and resources. It allows us to
                focus on what we do best without reinventing analytics. It’s
                been a game-changer for us. "

              <h4 id="why-metabase">Why Metabase?</h4>

              <p>
                Brian first discovered Metabase in a YouTube video on the top 10
                open-source products. Although they didn’t have an immediate use
                case at the time, Metabase stayed on their radar.
              </p>

              <p>
                When Marketfuel began development, the team knew tightly
                integrated analytics would differentiate their product.
                Attending a <a href="/events/"
                  >webinar on customer-facing analytics</a
                > solidified their decision to adopt Metabase.
              </p>

              <p>
                “We were chatting on Slack during the webinar, and we were blown
                away by the capabilities. The Embedded Analytics SDK was the
                icing on the cake.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Seamless in-app reporting that maintained a cohesive branded
                experience was a non-negotiable feature. To achieve this,
                Marketfuel needed a scalable and customizable embedded analytics
                solution to enhance their product, deliver an exceptional user
                experience, and maintain a competitive edge. Partnering with
                Metabase helped them accelerate their time to market, increase
                customer engagement, and focus on their core strengths without
                building analytics infrastructure from scratch.
              </p>

              <h4 id="the-data">The data</h4>

              <p>Marketfuel’s in-app reporting focuses on two key areas:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Inventory management:</strong> Insights into inventory
                  levels, stock turnover rates, and reorder thresholds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Order fulfillment:</strong> Metrics on processing times,
                  on-time deliveries, and shipment statuses. These analytics enable
                  end-users to optimize supply chain performance and enhance overall
                  eCommerce operations.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 id="how-marketfuel-team-uses-metabase">
                How Marketfuel team uses Metabase
              </h4>

              <p>Marketfuel uses Metabase in several ways:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Client-facing dashboards:</strong> Agencies can create
                  and manage dashboards for their clients, embedding them seamlessly
                  into storefronts. Agencies can choose from ready-to-use dashboards
                  or create dynamic, interactive dashboards tailored to their end-users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Internal use:</strong> Static dashboards in their admin
                  application help their team monitor key metrics.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                “We have a fail-fast mentality. If a tool doesn’t work, we move
                on. But Metabase impressed us right from the start. With the
                SDK, we could grab components, tailor them to our needs, and
                integrate them seamlessly.”
              </p>

              <h4 id="the-results">The results</h4>

              <p>
                Marketfuel achieved proof of concept for their in-app reporting
                in under 30 days, with a single developer using the Embedded
                Analytics SDK. Most of this time was spent setting up DevOps for
                self-hosting.
              </p>

              <p>
                The team finds Metabase intuitive and developer-friendly. Brian
                notes: “If it excites a developer, it’ll look great and be easy
                for our clients and end-users to use as well.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Although still early in their journey, Marketfuel is confident
                in their path. The interactivity and customization of their
                dashboards are key differentiators that enhance their value
                proposition.
              </p>

              <p>
                “Metabase has made our product stickier and more valuable to
                customers, which is a huge competitive advantage.”
