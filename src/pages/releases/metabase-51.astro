                  Metabase 51 has a bunch of new stuff to help your team make
                  the most of your data: viz upgrades, drill-through
                  improvements, more tools to manage accounts and keep your
                  Metabase tidy, and a lot more.

                  You thought your dashboards were cool before. Now you can add

                    >iframe cards</a
                  >. Think Loom recordings, Google Docs, a Typeform widget
                  survey—whatever you can dream up and put in an iframe, you can
                  now put on your Metabase dashboard. Have everything in one
                  dashboard so people have all the context in one place.

                <p>
                  Give your team an <a href="/docs/latest/data-modeling/metrics"
                    >official way to calculate things in Metabase with metrics</a
                  >. Join two or more metrics to make a new metric, or join with
                  additional data sources, e.g., to find the revenue from your
                  department.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Metrics could previously only be created and viewed by admins.
                  Now anyone can create new metrics and save to collections.
                  Like models, metrics now have their own page you can browse.
                  Admins can also mark vetted metrics as official, so people
                  know they’re using moderated calculations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When you upgrade, Metabase will move any existing metrics you
                  have into a new collection (you’ll no longer see metrics in
                  your admin settings).

                <p>
                  If you’ve got a KPI that you want to view by week, month,
                  quarter, etc., now you’re just a click away from adjusting the
                  time granularity without having to rewrite the query for
                  different <a

                <p>
                  Databricks was previously available as a community driver,
                  which meant you could connect to Metabase, but it was <a

                  > and we didn’t officially support it (in spirit, yes, but not
                  in an active, development-time, help-on-offer, kind of way). <a

                <p>
                  This is a step towards expanding our notification options in
                  Metabase with more to come over in future releases. Think
                  subscriptions, system events, and more.

                  You now have more flexibility and control over how your pie
                  chart legends are named, ordered, what to show and hide, or
                  how many decimal places to include.

                <p>
                  Pivot tables will keep all their pivoty goodness when exported
                  in a download or dashboard subscription, so you can continue
                  working on the table in Excel.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another thing: by default, all exported data keeps the
                  formatting you set in Metabase (e.g., if you formatted 187.50
                  as $187.50), but you can opt to download without formatting if
                  you take your data raw.

                  If “Drill-through doesn’t work on SQL questions” looks
                  familiar to you - we’ve got great news. Now when you click on
                  table results and charts made with SQL, you’ll see
                  column-heading filters, distribution, and drill-through
                  options. There are still some things sacred to the realm of
                  questions made with the query builder, like the ability to
                  breakout by category, and ‘See all records’, but our updates
                  to the native query editor will help people pull threads and
                  explore data in more places, regardless of whether the
                  question was made with SQL or the query editor. No
                  configuration needed.

                  Does what it says on the <del>trashcan</del> tin. Archiving content
                  was often done with the intention of getting rid of it. Although
                  items were out of sight and out of mind, they weren’t really gone.
                  If you got a link to an archived item you couldn’t see it or resurrect
                  it. Now, if you happen to see something that’s been trashed, there’ll
                  be a clear indication with a banner and you’ll have the option
                  to restore or delete it permanently.
