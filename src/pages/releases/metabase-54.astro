                  Better table visualization
                </h2>

                <p>
                  <img
                    src="/images/posts/metabase-54/table-viz.jpg"
                    alt="table-viz"
                  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  We’ve upgraded our table visualization with some of your
                  most-requested features. You can now wrap text in cells, so no
                  more squinting at cut-off content. You can align column values
                  to better fit and format your data, and toggle row index
                  numbers to help you keep your place in longer tables. Tables
                  also perform more smoothly with large datasets, and they now
                  sport table headers with a cleaner, more clickable design.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dashboard tables are now scrollable by default, so no more
                  click-click-click to view your data. But if pagination is more
                  your speed, you still have that option too.
                </p>

                <h2 id="smarter-custom-expression-editor">
                  Smarter custom expression editor
                </h2>

                <p>
                  <img
                    src="/images/posts/metabase-54/expression.jpg"
                    alt="expression"
                  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  The <a href="/docs/latest/questions/query-builder/expressions"
                    >custom expression editor</a
                  > now supports multi-line expressions, auto-formatting, and a built-in
                  function browser to help you write more complex logic. The editor
                  is more forgiving, too—no more losing your work if you accidentally
                  click away. And it makes better suggestions.
                </p>

                <p>On top of that, we’ve added some new functions:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Type-casting functions — Convert values with <code
                      class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text()</code
                    >, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                      >integer()</code
                    >, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                      >date()</code
                    > (currently for Postgres). Perfect for cleaning up mismatched
                    data types, like turning a string into a number so you can run
                    calculations or apply numeric filters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                      >splitPart()</code
                    > — Extract a specific part of a string based on a separator
                    (Postgres only). Great for things like pulling out just the first
                    or last name from a full name.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                      >path()</code
                    > — Pull out just the /path/…. part of a full URL.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                      >distinctIf()</code
                    > — Count distinct values that meet a specific condition.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="more-control-over-alerts">More control over alerts</h2>

                  />
                </p>

                <p>
                  The new “by the minute” feature lets you schedule <a
                    href="/docs/latest/questions/alerts">alerts</a
                  > to repeat every N minutes (e.g., every 10 minutes starting at
                  the top of the hour). If you prefer alerts at a specific time within
                  each hour, the updated “hourly” option now includes a setting to
                  trigger alerts at a chosen minute past the hour (think 00:10, 01:10,
                  02:10). For less frequent check-ins, schedule alerts monthly. And
                  for complete control, use cron expressions to fine-tune your alert
                  timing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Bypass getting someone to ETL your data in for you (or save
                  yourself a job if that person is you). Now instead of
                  downloading and re-uploading CSVs you can connect straight to
                  Google Drive and start working with your Sheets data in
                  Metabase.

                </p>

                <p>
                  On charts and tables, we replaced the full-screen filter modal
                  with a filter dropdown menu to make filtering more consistent
                  with the query builder’s editor. It’s now easier search for
                  columns to filter and see which filters are applied.

                  > without manual setup. Keys can be securely generated, assigned
                  to permission groups, and even pulled from environment variables.
                  Existing keys won’t be overwritten, so updates stay safe. Perfect
                  for smoother, more reliable deployments across all environments.

                  CSV downloads are now more consistent with what you see in
                  Metabase. No more mismatches between your pivot table in the
                  app and the data in your downloaded file.

                </h2>

                <p>
                  We’ve updated some behind-the-scenes parts of the SQL and
                  custom expression editor, bringing better performance, fixing
                  autocomplete bugs, and laying the groundwork for future
                  enhancements, like custom syntax highlighting.

                <p>
                  Columns with BigInt types (often used for IDs) were sometimes
                  displayed incorrectly due to JavaScript’s limitations with
                  very large numbers. We now handle these safely by converting
                  them to strings when needed, and formatting them correctly
                  using native <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BigInt</code
                  > support in JavaScript.

                  These databases now have full official support from the

                  more reliability, faster fixes, and peace of mind. Bonus: the

                <p>
                  We now cache filter values based on usage, dramatically
                  reducing load during initial database setup while making
                  filters feel more intuitive and responsive.

                </h2>

                <p>
                  We’ve added more data to give you better visibility into how
                  people are working with your Metabase. System tasks now
                  include a status column, so you can spot failures faster,
                  filter for them, and dig into metadata to debug. In Content,
                  you’ll find new columns like <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                    >is_verified</code
                  > and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"
                    >is_official</code
                  > to help you track trusted content and curated collections more
                  easily.
                </p>

                <p>
                  And now mystery IDs and Entity Qualified IDs now show up as
                  actual names, not unreadable strings. Easier to scan, easier
                  to filter, less detective work.

                <p>
                  Thanks for your support in making <a
                    href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/metabase#metabase-embedded-analytics"
                    >Embedded Analytics a Top 3 Product of the Day on Product
                    Hunt</a
                  >! Here’s a few new ways to make it easier for your customers
                  to get answers to their questions.
                </p>

                  Simplified data picker for asking questions
                </h2>

                <p>
                  We’ve made it easier for people using the embedded query
                  builder to find the right starting point for their analysis.
                </p>

                <h2

                  More control over what data customers see in the data picker
                  and browse data
                </h2>

                <p>
                  You can now choose whether to <a
                    href="/docs/latest/embedding/interactive-ui-components#entity_types"
                    >show tables, models, or both</a
                  >. Models are often the better choice for guiding people,
                  since they let you define cleaner starting points for analysis
                  — with curated fields, simplified joins, and a more focused
                  exploration experience.

                    are built and managed by the open-source community, are not
                    officially supported by Metabase, and can only be used when
