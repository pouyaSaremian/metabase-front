# TypeScript Standards

## Type Safety Requirements

- Everything must be typesafe
- The codebase must not use the TypeScript 'any' type anywhere
- The project must be well-typed with all types explicitly specified
- Prefer solving TypeScript type errors properly rather than using @ts-ignore
- Use consts instead of functions, for example: `const toggle = () => {}`
- Always define types when possible

## Function and Variable Naming

- Use descriptive variable and function/const names
- Event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix:
  - `handleClick` for onClick
  - `handleKeyDown` for onKeyDown
  - `handleSubmit` for onSubmit
- Use early returns whenever possible to make code more readable

## Code Structure

- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement Next.js and React best practices for scalable and robust code
- Use DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Focus on clean, readable code structure
